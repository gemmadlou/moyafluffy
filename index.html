                  <p>Update - January 29 2017</p>
                  <p>Hi there! I'm sad that to see my wonderful furry friends go. They are 7 year old, Moya + Fluffy. The boy is long haired, hence his name...the
                    girl is named after a caring spaceship from Sci-Fi TV Show, Farscape. :D</p>
                    <p>I want them to rehome them into a new loving family, one where they can go outdoors instead of watching the world from our
                       balcony. It's unfair to them to keep them as house cats when I've seen them taste the wider world with joy
                      and pleasure. My main concern was separating them. Sometimes I think they annoy one another. Other times
                      it seems they love the company of each other, and have great joy in playing their cat games together.</p>
                    <p>Moya is incredibly curious and adventurous, so she needs lots of stimulation, lots of games with toys and 
                      even with you the owner.
                      Fluffy is relaxed and chilled out. He will complain if you don't spend some time with him too.</p>
                    <p>If you are willing to become their new family, contact me <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ATpLlG8DU_fxCqqnRsfFfFTdqopS5_oKcjJyeAf9ps0/viewform" target="_blank">here</a> and I'll get in touch.</p>
                  <p>Alternatively, you can email me at gblackuk@googlemail.com</p>

                    <p>As they get older, they will need more age-related care, especially in Fluffy's case.</p>

                    <h3>A Horrible Fall</h3>
                    <p>Fluffy had an accident falling off our balcony which resulted in a dislocated hip.
                    His sister then fell, but somehow was able to survive unscraped. Fluffy is adorable, but unfortunately, not very strong.</p>
                    <p>I'm sure he experienced a lot of pain as his bones were healing. Even now,
                    if you press his back legs too heavily, he will meow or even scartch. Moya doesn't realise this, so when she plays,
                    he sometimes winces in pain. You will have to stop their play fighting if you hear him cry.</p>
                    <h3>A Long Disappearance</h3>
                    <p>Fluffy's misfortune doesn't stop there. A few years ago, he went missing. 9 months later, we finally received a call. Someone brought him into the vets.
                        He lost half his tail, and what was left, he didn't feel. The rest was surgically removed. Hopefully he'll continue to be just fine, but his
                    balance will not be 100%.</p>
                    <p>We want him to have the best care as possible, because he is such a friendly cat. He loves people,
                      he loves being around us and our friends. He's unlike any cat we've ever seen before.</p>
